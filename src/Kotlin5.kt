// Getting started with getters and setters. Now getters and setters are used to modify the variables.
// read and change variables
/*
    The most basic getter and setter (default is)

    get() = field
    set(value){
    field = value
    }


Getter: What to do when someone says "Show me the value."

Setter: What to do when someone says "Change the value."
